# Python Patterns and Practice Problems – Week 3

This repository includes Python programs focused on pattern printing and basic problem-solving from Week 3 of my AI/ML learning plan.

## 🔍 Topics Covered
- Pattern printing using `for` loops
- Right-angle triangle, inverted, and pyramid patterns
- Number-based patterns
- Nested loops
- Basic logic-building programs
- Loop-based practice problems

## 📁 Folder Structure
Each program is written separately and includes beginner-level examples for patterns and logic development.

## 🚀 Goal
Improve logic-building skills using loops and nested loops. Build confidence by solving pattern and beginner-friendly logic problems in Python.
